# Week-4-Prep-project
Python Programming Data Science IP Project.

# Description

In this project, I will be working as a data scientist working for an electric car-sharing service company. You have been tasked to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time by solving for the following research question;
Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
Other bonus questions asked are;
What is the most popular hour for returning cars?
What station is the most popular?
Overall?
At the most popular picking hour?
What postal code is the most popular for picking up Blue cars? Does the most popular station belong to that postal code?
Overall?
At the most popular picking hour?
Do the results change if you consider Utilib and Utilib 1.4 instead of Blue cars?
